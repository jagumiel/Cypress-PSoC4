# Cypress-PSoC4

This repository contains some **examples to start with Cypress PSoC 4** platform. I have followed the tutorials from **"Cypress Academy: PSoC 101"**, you can find them on the following YouTube's list: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrXXpQr1itY&list=PLX6sqqUB8iOjsMfGEDcsPSuYLEFCh50Hr

I think Cypress made a great work, the tutorials were short and easy to follow, and are the base for more complex developments in the future. If you are getting familiar with the PSoC platform, I encourage you to watch them.

I am using the Cypress CY8CKIT-042, and the projects on this repository were designed and compiled for that board, but in case you are using another PSoC kit, you just have to change the device and adjust the pin-out.


# Repository Structure

In the following lines I will specify what you can find in the folders.

## Lesson 1: Software Output Pins
In this lesson we learn about the software outputs. In this example we are programming the software to blink a led. This is such a *"Hello World"* program, and this will be useful to generate digital signals through software in the future.

## Lesson 2: Software Input Pins
This example was made to learn how to read from input pins. In this scenario we use the on-board switch. Additionally, the intention is to work with the schematics, adding new components  and configuring them. The program function is to read the input value and assigning it to a led, which is the output, as in the first example. All of this is made by software.
